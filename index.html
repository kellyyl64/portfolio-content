            <p>This is a project for SI539. The project targets to examine how different video games depict cultures. 
            Cultures depicted may be from the production team own background and also may differ from the production team background. 
            I wanted to center my project around this topic because video games are a passion of mine and really wanted to make some of my academic
            projects about the things that I'm passionate about. Hopefully I can write something that broadens my knowledge on cultural depiction
            in video games and at the same time learn about how to built a website from (nearly) scratch!</p>

            <p>The selected games include: Genshin Impact, Persona 5 Royal, and Assassin Creed Origin. 
            Cultures presented are: Genshin Impact - China, Persona 5 Royal - modern day Japan, 
            Assassin Creed Origin - ancient Egypt. Reasons I picked these games are because scenery locations (in my opinion) are a 
            big selling point to the game. The locations presented in the game very closely mimic real life locations.
            Players are able to experience real places they haven't been before through video games that transcends both distance and time.
            For example, the Assassin's Creed Origin take place in Ancient Egypt where players are able to explore places
            that are re-imaginations of Egypt while learning about Egyptian cultures such as food, livestock, and even swear words.</p>
